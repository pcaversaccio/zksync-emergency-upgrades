# Proposal ID Calculation for ZKsync `executeEmergencyUpgrade`s

The function `executeEmergencyUpgrade` will be invoked in the following contract:

- `ProtocolUpgradeHandler`: [`0x8f7a9912416e8AdC4D9c21FAe1415D3318A11897`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8f7a9912416e8AdC4D9c21FAe1415D3318A11897#code)

```solidity
/// @dev Represents a call to be made during an upgrade.
/// @param target The address to which the call will be made.
/// @param value The amount of Ether (in wei) to be sent along with the call.
/// @param data The calldata to be executed on the `target` address.
struct Call {
    address target;
    uint256 value;
    bytes data;
}

/// @dev Defines the structure of an upgrade that is executed by Protocol Upgrade Handler.
/// @param executor The L1 address that is authorized to perform the upgrade execution (if address(0) then anyone).
/// @param calls An array of `Call` structs, each representing a call to be made during the upgrade execution.
/// @param salt A bytes32 value used for creating unique upgrade proposal hashes.
struct UpgradeProposal {
    Call[] calls;
    address executor;
    bytes32 salt;
}

/// @notice Executes an emergency upgrade proposal initiated by the emergency upgrade board.
/// @param _proposal The upgrade proposal details including proposed actions and the executor address.
function executeEmergencyUpgrade(UpgradeProposal calldata _proposal) external payable onlyEmergencyUpgradeBoard {
    bytes32 id = keccak256(abi.encode(_proposal));
    UpgradeState upgState = upgradeState(id);
    // 1. Checks
    require(upgState == UpgradeState.None, "Upgrade already exists");
    require(_proposal.executor == msg.sender, "msg.sender is not authorized to perform the upgrade");
    // 2. Effects
    upgradeStatus[id].executed = true;
    // Clear the freeze
    lastFreezeStatusInUpgradeCycle = FreezeStatus.None;
    protocolFrozenUntil = 0;
    _unfreeze();
    // 3. Interactions
    _execute(_proposal.calls);
    emit Unfreeze();
    emit EmergencyUpgradeExecuted(id);
}
```

In order the retrieve the proposal ID, we need to calculate:

```solidity
keccak256(abi.encode(_proposal));
```

## Usage

Adjust the `executor`, `salt`, and `calls` parameters either in [`ProposalIdGoLive.sol`](./ProposalIdGoLive.sol) or [`proposal_id_go_live.sh`](./proposal_id_go_live.sh) and invoke

```console
forge script ProposalIdGoLive.sol --target-contract ProposalIdGoLive --sig "computeProposalId()"
```

or

```console
./proposal_id_go_live.sh
```

### Example 1 – Go-Live Emergency Upgrade

The proposal ID, given by the ZKsync Era UI is `0xdd9aadc3b6e3297fed40a2cf0a7e655ff5af02c9ce918ed0e86f538c1c53ce9d`. So we need to verify that one.

From the docs [here](https://hackmd.io/@alishaZK/BJ7-jEv2C#Transaction-20), we know:

```console
bytes32 salt = 0x646563656e7472616c697a6174696f6e206973206e6f74206f7074696f6e616c
```

The executor in our case is [`0xdEFd1eDEE3E8c5965216bd59C866f7f5307C9b29`](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdEFd1eDEE3E8c5965216bd59C866f7f5307C9b29), the `EmergencyUpgradeBoard` contract.

Save the following Solidity code as `ProposalId.sol` in your root directory.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: WTFPL
pragma solidity ^0.8.28;

contract ProposalId {
    struct Call {
        address target;
        uint256 value;
        bytes data;
    }

    struct UpgradeProposal {
        Call[] calls;
        address executor;
        bytes32 salt;
    }

    function computeProposalId() external pure returns (bytes32) {
        Call[] memory calls = new Call[](4);
        calls[0] = Call({target: 0xD7f9f54194C633F36CCD5F3da84ad4a1c38cB2cB, value: 0, data: hex"79ba5097"});
        calls[1] = Call({target: 0x303a465B659cBB0ab36eE643eA362c509EEb5213, value: 0, data: hex"79ba5097"});
        calls[2] = Call({target: 0xc2eE6b6af7d616f6e27ce7F4A451Aedc2b0F5f5C, value: 0, data: hex"79ba5097"});
        calls[3] = Call({target: 0x5D8ba173Dc6C3c90C8f7C04C9288BeF5FDbAd06E, value: 0, data: hex"79ba5097"});

        address executor = 0xdEFd1eDEE3E8c5965216bd59C866f7f5307C9b29;
        bytes32 salt = hex"646563656e7472616c697a6174696f6e206973206e6f74206f7074696f6e616c";

        UpgradeProposal memory upgradeProposal = UpgradeProposal({calls: calls, executor: executor, salt: salt});

        return keccak256(abi.encode(upgradeProposal));
    }
}
```

Now invoke:

```console
forge script ProposalId.sol --target-contract ProposalId --sig "computeProposalId()"
```

which will output:

```console
== Return ==
0: bytes32 0xdd9aadc3b6e3297fed40a2cf0a7e655ff5af02c9ce918ed0e86f538c1c53ce9d
```

Q.E.D. 🥳🥳

### Example 2 – Accept Ownership After ZIP5 Emergency Upgrade

The upgrade data for the emergency upgrade "Accept ownership after ZIP5":

```json

}
```

**Proposal ID Calculation**

```console
./proposal_id_zip5.sh
```

returns

```console
